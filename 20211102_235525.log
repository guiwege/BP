We started off with MySQL but after growing quickly, we were forced to look into partitioning of the data. PostgreSQL was made to be easy for advanced stuff like that. We tried to do it with MySQL and failed because we\'re not MySQL experts and we managed to get it working with Postgres. Postgres has better documentation than MySQL so that might be the factor if you don\'t have a DBA you can readily ask for help. Here\'s a write-up by someone who went through similar process:<p><a href="http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/archive/2006/11/04/166">http://enfranchisedmind.com/blog/archive/2006/11/04/166</a><p>Also, if you use Postgres on multi-CPU machines, it\'s faster than MySQL.

We are also moving to VPS architecture and Postgres\' performance advantage over MySQL on a VPS doesn\'t really exist.<p>In the end, go with what your staff/friends know and what your hosting place recommends. If they have an optimized DB stack and provide some kind of a support for it, stick with that DB because you can always go to them for help!\n', 'time': 1174257816, 'type': 'comment'}

If you've never actually tried to produce something complex quickly by burning hard give this a shot.  It is very inspirational to be able to look back at the end and see what you've done.  If you're planning on doing a web startup I'd also recommend it as a team building activity.  The stress is high, the time limiting, and the competition hectic.  You'll find out quickly how well you can work with people in a crunch.  And you will learn a lot both about coding and the people you work with.<p>This is the third one that Erik and I will be entering into.

Even the cellphone companies aren't able to do this. Nokia tried to make a software program that would let you find your friends, and they could only make it work on seven or eight of their OWN phones. Yahoo has search software that works on many models of phones, but they also have 100 hackers employed to work full time on just that. You won't have 100 people.<p>2) The cell phone carriers turn off parts of the bluetooth spectrum to prevent people from downloading their own ringtones. This also prevents people from using your software if it needs bluetooth.<p>3) Cell phone carriers will never partner with you. At least not on terms that allow you to make a profit.<p>4) Even if one cell phone carrier partners with you, the rest won't.<p>5) Any software that takes advantage of the phone feature will drain the battery very fast. If you need to ping the cell tower ever five minutes, that means you have to recharge the phone every two hours. Which essentially means the phone is now worthless for making calls.<p>6) Most people don't know how to load software onto their cellphone, even if they were willing to pay for it.<p>7) Even if you can get some people using your software on their phone, to everyone else it will just look like they are sending text messages. If no one can see others using your software then it isn't viral and it won't spread.<p>8) Cell phones don't fit into the pockets of girls pants. (This is actually a serious problems)<p>9) There have been hundreds of entrepreneurs who have gone into mobile, and they have all failed. I can name two dozen companies that have tried to do social networking over cell phones. It's clearly something people want, but none have been able to release a decent product for the reasons above.<p>10) The next generation of WiFi will make probably make your product obsolete in two years anyway.", 'time': 1174339465, 'type': 'comment'}

Even if Apollo catches on like nothing since C, it wouldn't kill Firefox; the user still needs a browser.<p>Yes, FF supports rich application development in XUL, and yes, Apollo might compete with that somewhat, but it doesn't really matter.  XUL is there not as a feature but as a tool: the FF UI is built with XUL.  That it is useful for others is really just a detail.  In FF3, there will be more emphasis and support given to XUL apps, but still, it's there for the browser.<p>Also, the degree of competitions between FF and Apollo is, I think, overestimated.  Apollo is basically just another RAD toolkit.  XUL apps aren't desktop apps, they run directly in the browser just like Ajax apps.  That gives them an entirely different use case than Apollo.  (E.g. if FF becomes widespread, XUL might compete with Ajax when building something like gmail.  Apollo wouldn't--a desktop app built with web tech is still a desktop app.)", 'time': 1174366790, 'type': 'comment'}

It is by far one of my favorite web tools, and I think one of the most useful things about it is the way that it encourages a sort of conversation between its users (ie, someone can send a bookmrak to me, which of itself, begins a sort of dialogue between us, or can write a description in the notes taht I know is intended for me). What I find disappointing sometimes is that when this happens there is no way for me respond to them directly about the link (you can send messages to another user, but then you lose a lot of the context). The most obvious answer would be to allow me to comment on other users\' bookmarks or "send" them a message back about the bookmark they sent me. The explanation I keep getting when I say this is that they didn\'t want to distract users or muddy the purpose of the app by turning it into another blogging tool. Ultimately, I think they made the right choice not to add this feature. It keeps it clean and useful while still allowing for self expression within the core of the application. I would probably like Digg a lot more if I weren\'t so damned distracted by all of the threaded comments that follow each post, most of which are completely useless.', 'time': 1174372502, 'type': 'comment'}

His point about your # of customers being proportional to the difficulty of refactoring is well taken, but for an early startup this probably does not mean as much as he suggests. On the web you can do a great deal that is transparent to your customers. The risk of this approach might lie more in not having to discipline to take the time to refactor as you go as opposed to not having the technical ability. 37 Signals seems to have had certain project go very well for them by pushing down abstractions as they went (granting however, that everyone can\'t count on a gang of open source hackers coming in and both contributing to and evangelizing your product\'s infrastructure - though maybe this isn\'t a bad goal?).

I didn\'t see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I\'ll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they\'re <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that\'s what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person\'s life, because it\'s <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you\'re setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you\'ve set yourself up on a pedestal, you\'ve given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn\'t really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there\'s nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?  Almost all the problems tonight could\'ve been predicted from his articles.  <a href="http://shirky.com/.">http://shirky.com/.</a><p>8. Lose the arrogance.  Kyle was bragging about his 1337 MIT CS skillz in the chatroom.  Emmett was talking about their being only a finite number of attack vectors, and he\'d have them all patched in a week.  In my experience, <i>never</i> underestimate the clever things people will do to break your system.  People will still be finding ways to abuse it a year from now, assuming it still exists.  The arrogance is just an invitation for them to try harder.<p>9. I won\'t be back, mostly because this is a complete waste of time.  But I thought I\'d give you the courtesy of telling you why I won\'t be back.', 'time': 1174454190, 'type': 'comment'}

But that difference only comes into play when you've got no competition, and if you've got no competition for a keyword, it's extremely unlikely that it's going to be a lucrative one.<p>The key point is that Google figures out how much it makes by sending people to a site, and ranks the sites based on that metric. So just like Adwords, there's no getting around the fact that paying Google more (by bidding higher, or on more frequent events) will get you better placement, and therefore more traffic.", 'time': 1174466593, 'type': 'comment'}

{'by': 'python_kiss', 'id': 5605, 'parent': 5576, 'text': 'Dan, thank you for sharing that awesome list. Joel\'s recommended books are great; in fact, back when I was developing a micro ISV, I used to turn to Joel\'s website for advice. That is where I discovered Paul Graham\'s "Hackers and Painters". Since then, I have shifted my allegiance to a new mentor :) I think the book brought three major changes in how I think:<p>1. Think big: Since I was developing a micro ISV, I had never really considered scaling the business to millions of customers (aka users). "Hackers and Painters" entered my life just a few weeks before I was about to launch my product; and I realized I had to develop something that can scale. I took a leap of faith and decided to instead pursue web startups; the opportunities for growth were many times in magnitude.<p>2. There are others like me: Toronto, Canada is not exactly a Silicon Valley. So uptil then, I didn\'t know there were so many other young entrepreneurs pursuing the same goals as me. Eventhough I wasn\'t acquainted with other hackers, I could at least gain a sense of security that I am not alone.<p>3. The Art of the Start: The single most valuable lesson I learned from Paul\'s book was the governing dynamics of web startups. Before reading it, there was not much inspiration or reason to think big because even if I did venture into online startups, I wouldn\'t know what to do.<p>\nWhile I have read some excellent books, I can credit Paul\'s work for watering the first seeds.', 'time': 1174535789, 'type': 'comment'}

I was tempted to read it all at once, but decided to spread it out over 2 weeks.
